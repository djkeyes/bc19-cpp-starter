# bc19-cpp-starter
C++ Starter Code for Battlecode 2019

# Requirements:
 - CMake. Currently version 3.9+ is required (but send a PR if it works on a lower version).
 - Emscripten sdk. See [here](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) for installation instructions.
 - Node.js

Currently tested on Ubuntu 16.04.

# Usage:

You just need to run `cpp/compile.sh` . This generates several files ending in `_GENERATED.js` and copies them to the root directory, where they are loaded by `robot.js`. From there, you can run the bot just like any other javascript bot using `bc19run`.
